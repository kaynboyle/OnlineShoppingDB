deployed app: 
This application is used to view, add, update, and delete items from the ecomerce data base which is seeded from the companies information that includes item id numbers tags prices and other features. There is no front end for this project so it is run from the terminal and the calls are then made in an application like insomnia or postman. The video example of the delete, post, get and put functions is included below.
